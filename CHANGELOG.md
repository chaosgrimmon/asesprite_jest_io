### jest_import_packed_atlas
* Fix CLI not working, forgot to merge in the code
* Fix CLI readme instructions
* Improved Ergonomics: We assume that the .json file is in the same directory as the .png file so you can just hit Ok if it is. This is the common case for me

### jest_import_existing_tags.lua
* Removed finsihed TODO comment
